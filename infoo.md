# Why some optifine features and other mods were not added?

There are many reasons for this, but the main reason why some performance mods make significant changes to Minecraft that can make the game unstable, such as game crashes
world corruption
and much more

## With performance mods everything is clear but why werenâ€™t optifine functions like zoom added?

From a vanilla point of view it is considered cheating and unnecessary

zoom is already in the vanilla game in the form of a spyglass
and optifine makes the spyglass useless, which breaks vanilla parity
although if someone needs this function you can still add it yourself

## more about optimization mods and why some were not added and can they be added in the future?

Let's start with the most effective server-side performance mod

C2me (Concurrent chunk management)

the main reason why c2me was not added
at the moment it is not stable and can harm the worlds of players; this is directly stated on its page on modrinth

Faster random

Faster random was not added due to a change in the generation of the world, which can especially manifest itself in old worlds on new chunks in the form of trees cut off along the floors, closed or incorrectly generated caves

Nvidium
A very effective performance mod for gtx 16xx and higher video cards
Allows you to render a large number of chunks without lags

but there are reasons why it was not added
The problem is that in a vanilla game without c2me you cannot set the rendering above 32 chunks

yes there is a mod bobby and with it
nvidium is capable of loading rendering above 128 chunks 
But there is a main problem: these chunks must first be visited then bobby will be able to display them, which is very ineffective in a single player game 

and on 32 chunks and below nvidium does not provide much benefit

and no nvidium does not accelerate the rendering of distant horizons, it has no effect on it

the second reason is that it is still in beta and can sometimes crash the game, which is beyond the scope of the modpack

also breaks world icons in the world list

Noisium

so far not very well tested and in theory it could break or change something in the world generation

Distant horizons

the main reason why it is not there is that distant horizons creates lod chunks extremely slowly
and when the priority increases from medium to high 
the game starts to stutter and chunks are still created quite slowly
Yes, you can leave the PC turned on at night and distant horizons will create chunks, but when traveling far from the base, instead of a huge rendering, there will be an empty world and a standard rendering of the world, which makes it not suitable for PO modpack

Very Many Players (VMP)
The most experimental mod and not a stable mod
be at an early stage of development
can improve performance with high player counts
and even in single player

can also harm worlds or crash the game


## Which of these mods can be added in the future?
nvidium may be added in the future when it is more stable and polished

c2me is possible if it becomes more stable
